  abstract = {The classical Losev-Manin space can be interpreted as a toric compactification of the moduli space of n points in the affine line modulo translation and scaling. Motivated by this, we study its higher-dimensional toric counterparts, which compactify the moduli space of n distinct labeled points in affine space modulo translation and scaling. We show that these moduli spaces are a fibration over a product of projective spaces -- with fibers isomorphic to the Losev-Manin space -- and that they are isomorphic to the normalization of a Chow quotient. Moreover, we present a criterion to decide whether the blow-up of a toric variety along the closure of a subtorus is a Mori dream space. As an application, we demonstrate that a related generalization of the moduli space of pointed rational curves proposed by Chen, Gibney, and Krashen is not a Mori dream space when the number of points is at least nine, regardless of the dimension.}

  abstract = {We investigate the combinatorics of max-pooling layers, which are functions that downsample input arrays by taking the maximum over shifted windows of input coordinates, and which are commonly used in convolutional neural networks. We obtain results on the number of linearity regions of these functions by equivalently counting the number of vertices of certain Minkowski sums of simplices. We characterize the faces of such polytopes and obtain generating functions and closed formulas for the number of vertices and facets in a 1D max-pooling layer depending on the size of the pooling windows and stride, and for the number of vertices in a special case of 2D max-pooling.}
