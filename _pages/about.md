I am a visiting assistant professor at UC Riverside since July 2020. Before this I obtained my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~karu/">Kalle Karu</a> at <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/">UBC</a>. I am interested in algebraic geometry and its interactions with commutative algebra and combinatorics. 

 I was born and raised in Mexico City, where I completed my undergraduate studies in physics and a master's degree in mathematics at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico">National Autonomous University of Mexico </a> (UNAM), both under the supervision of Adolfo SÃ¡nchez Valenzuela. I have <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs#Naming_system_in_Spain">two last names and no middle name</a>: Gonz&aacute and Anaya are my father's and mother's surnames, respectively.
