I am an algebraic geometer studying the geometric and combinatorial structures arising from birational geometry, moduli theory, and other fields such as the theory of polytopes and machine learning. Currently I am a visiting assistant professor at Harvey Mudd College. Before this, I was a visiting assistant professor at the University of California at Riverside between 2020 and 2023, right after I finished my PhD in 2020.

Beginning in Fall 2025, I will join <a href="https://www.scu.edu/" target="_blank">Santa Clara University</a> as an Assistant Professor.

As a mathematics educator, I was awarded UCR's Outstanding VAP Award for Excellence in Teaching for the academic years 2021–2022 and 2022–2023. I find great joy in mentoring students in mathematical research through various activities including directing undergraduate theses, leading REUs, and guiding reading courses.

I was born and raised in Mexico City, where I completed my undergraduate studies in physics and a master's degree in mathematics. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_customs_of_Hispanic_America" target="_blank">I have two last names and no middle name</a>.
