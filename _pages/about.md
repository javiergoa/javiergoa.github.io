I am a visiting assistant professor at UC Riverside since July 2020. Before this I obtained my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~karu/">Kalle Karu</a> at <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/">UBC</a>. I am interested in algebraic geometry and its interactions with commutative algebra and combinatorics. 

 I was born and raised in Mexico City, where I completed my undergraduate studies in physics and a master's degree in mathematics at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico">National Autonomous University of Mexico </a> (UNAM), both under the supervision of Adolfo Sánchez Valenzuela. 
 
I have two last names and no middle name: González and Anaya are my father's and mother's surnames, respectively.  In Mexico and other Latin American countries it's common to follow the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs#Naming_system_in_Spain">Spanish naming conventions</a>.
