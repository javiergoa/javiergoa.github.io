TEST. My goal as an instructor and mentor is to help all students become more analytical and independent mathematical thinkers. By having an interactive lecture style and adhering to inclusive teaching principles, I create a environment where students feel compelled to engage with mathematical concepts. As a recognition of my work I won the 2021 - 2022 and 2022 - 2023 Outstanding VAP awards for excellence in teaching at UCR.

My <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/CV-JavierGA.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">CV</a> has a detailed account of the classes I've taught and my mentoring experiences.

<h3>Harvey Mudd College</h3>
My duties at HMC include teaching and being a mentor for their capstone experiences:<br>
   
   <b>Mentoring</b>:<br>
   <ul>
       <li>Senior Thesis: Guiding a senior undergraduate on a one-year research project on moduli theory and combinatorics.</li>
       <li>Clinic: I advice a team of seniors on their clinic project. Follow <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/capstone/clinic/" target="_blank">this link</a> to learn about what this means. </li>
</ul>

   <b>Teaching</b>: I am currently teaching a first course on ODEs and will be teaching linear algebra in the Spring semester.<br>	


<h3>University of California, Riverside</h3>
At UCR I have taught a variety of classes and mentored several students:<br>
   
   <b>Mentoring</b>:<br>
   <ul>
       <li>Faculty Mentor for the National Science Foundation funded California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) Summer Scholars program, designed for STEM students who want to pursue graduate degrees. The student has given three poster presentations at regional conferences; twice individually and one as part of a larger group.</li>
       <li>Co-led a 10-week summer REU in combinatorics of neural networks. They presented a poster at a regional conference and we have started working towards a publication aimed for early Spring 2023.</li>
       <li>Supervised an undergraduate student on reading graduate-level sheaf theory.</li>
</ul>

   <b>Teaching</b>: I've taught classes ranging from pre-calculus and calculus to proof-based courses in linear algebra and topology, passing through history of mathematics and elementary number theory.<br>

<h3>University of British Columbia</h3>
  As a graduate student at UBC I taught a calculus class with applications to STEM. I also participated in a semester-long mathematics education class and at UBC's Instructional Skills Workshop (an intensive weekend-long workshop aimed for graduate students who want to learn about current best practices and trends in mathematics education).
