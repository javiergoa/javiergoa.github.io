<p>My goal as an instructor and mentor is to help all students become more analytical and independent mathematical thinkers. By having an interactive lecture style and adhering to inclusive teaching principles, I create an environment where students feel compelled to engage with mathematical concepts. As a recognition of my work I won the 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 Outstanding VAP awards for excellence in teaching at UCR.</p>
<p>I have been the instructor of record for a wide variety of classes, ranging from linear algebra, multivariable calculus and ODEs, to courses in topology and number theory. </p>

<p>Below I expand a bit on my mentoring experiences. My <a href="/assets/pdf/CV-JavierGA.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> has a detailed account of all the classes I have taught and my mentoring experiences.</p>
<h3>Harvey Mudd College</h3>
<p>At HMC I have had the pleasure of being a mentor for the <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/capstone/clinic/" target="_blank">clinic program</a>, as well as a senior thesis advisor (check out our <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2409.08611" target="_blank">preprint!</a>). Last summer I co-led an REU on the interactions of moduli theory and combinatorics with <a href="https://www.math.hmc.edu/~dk/" target="_blank">Dagan Karp</a>.<br /></p>
<h3>University of California, Riverside</h3>
<p>While at UCR I enjoyed mentoring several students. This included being a mentor for the NSF funded California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) Summer Scholars program, as well as leading and co-leading Summer REUs, advising students, etc. <br /></p>
<h3>University of British Columbia</h3>
<p>As a graduate student at UBC I taught a calculus class with applications to STEM. I also participated in a semester-long class on best pedagogical practices for the mathematics classroom, as well as UBC’s Instructional Skills Workshop (an intensive weekend-long workshop aimed for graduate students who want to learn about current best practices and trends in mathematics education).</p>
